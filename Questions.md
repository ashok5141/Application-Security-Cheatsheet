- Assume a Subdomain called abc.com, A record has taken over (Identified the A record, then identified the IP address then exploited)
- `Content-length` and `Transfer-encoding` (It leads to the HTTP request smuggling)
- See whether HTTP request smuggling, what will be approch in the scale and mitigation (Try to change the content lenght and transfer encoding HTTP request, mitigation match both headers )
- HTTP 2.0 is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling
- What is SQL Injection, and how to fix it at the code level (Parameterised statements, Output encoding)
- IN SQL injection, CVSS score (What kind of data they are trying to retrieve, CIA tride high severity, if they trying to retrive currenty user details)
- In SQL injection one row out(if they trying to retrive currenty user details) in the injection what will be the integrity and availability impact(No change in the integrity, Availability try to do the DoS attack, not using SQLMap availability low)
- Take me through any vulnerability, find it really interesting, not need to the target details (Found in the jenkins RCE, jenkins has the feature groovy sheel put Groovy script get a reverse shell, Mitigation what ever features not using disabled, least privilege access, we get alerts in the SOC RCE) 
- How the RCE works in the AWS (Jenkins hosted in the AWS attacker also listening on the same port similar AWS kali host)
- You're an application owner with different teams, 3 finding CVSS score 10 and same vulnerability, teams bug bounty, pen test, vulnerability assessment team which one you prioritise first (First check all the things, is there any public exploits, internal team i for the internal patching first, i go for the bug bounty)
- Is there any separate team (run bug bounty to the external team, our team validate work with the internal teams)
- When you give what to test a new feature developed, which way is tested: only the new feature or entire application or a business feature (It's a layered approach, everything internet-facing is in scope. Internally, new features developed are tested with incremental testing, bug bounty full scope testing)
- In the bug bounty team, how does the test application Black, grey and white box testing (Bug bounty go for a black box approach, pen test covers every single on their if they did not find anything report, Incentiwise find exploitable, keep testing, find something report it, in the organisation entrily black testing)
