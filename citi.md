Good luck Ashok! You have a strong foundation ‚Äî focus on stakeholder scenarios, real examples, and cross-functional clarity to shine in this leadership-oriented role.





# Q / A

- **Can you explain what a vulnerability assessment is and how it differs from a penetration test?**
    - A vulnerability assessment is a systematic process of identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities in a system. It typically involves automated scanning tools and manual analysis to detect potential security issues. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation.
    - A penetration test, on the other hand, goes a step further by actively attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to determine their real-world impact. Penetration testing simulates an attacker‚Äôs actions to assess the effectiveness of security measures and identify weaknesses that may not be apparent in a vulnerability assessment. While vulnerability assessments focus on breadth, penetration tests focus on depth.

- **How do you stay updated with the latest vulnerabilities and threats?**
    - **Subscribing to Security Bulletins**: Receiving updates from vendors, security organizations, and government agencies.
    - **Participating in Security Communities**: Engaging with online forums, security conferences, and professional networks.
    - **Using Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Leveraging commercial or open-source threat intelligence services.

# Key Terms and Concepts from the Job Description


### 1. Third-party Penetration Testing Vendors

* **What it is:** These are external cybersecurity firms hired by Citi to simulate cyberattacks on its systems, applications, and networks. They are independent specialists, not Citi employees.
* **How it works:** Citi contracts with these vendors. Their ethical hackers use various tools and techniques to find security vulnerabilities, with the goal of helping Citi fix them before malicious attackers can exploit them.
* **Example:** Citi hires a firm like **NCC Group** to conduct a penetration test on a new online banking application. The vendor will perform checks on the web application, network, or mobile app to identify weaknesses.

---

### 2. Citi's Requirements

* **What it is:** These are the specific rules, standards, and policies that Citi mandates for any security activity, ensuring all assessments meet the company's internal security posture and regulatory obligations.
* **How it works:** These requirements cover key aspects of the testing process, including:
    * **Scope Definition:** What will be tested (e.g., specific URLs, IP ranges).
    * **Methodology:** The specific testing approaches and tools the vendor must use (e.g., OWASP Top 10 focus, PTES methodology).
    * **Reporting Standards:** The required format, content, and detail for the final report, including vulnerability severity ratings (e.g., CVSS scores).
    * **Legal & Compliance:** Adherence to data privacy and financial industry regulations.
* **Example:** A requirement might state: "All web application penetration tests must follow the OWASP Testing Guide v4 principles and provide a final report with vulnerabilities ranked by CVSSv3.1 score, submitted within 2 weeks."

---

### 3. The Central Liaison

* **What it is:** As the "External Vendor Vulnerability Assessments Lead," you are the primary point of contact and facilitator between internal Citi departments (the "businesses") and external penetration testing vendors. Your role is to be the communication bridge.
* **How it works:**
    * **Translating Needs:** You translate business needs into technical scopes for vendors and simplify complex technical findings into business risks for internal teams.
    * **Information Flow:** You ensure all necessary information (access, documentation) flows from Citi's internal teams to the vendor, and all vendor deliverables (reports, updates) flow back to Citi.
    * **Problem Resolution:** You mediate any issues that arise during testing.
* **Example:** A new mobile banking feature needs a penetration test. You would meet with the **Mobile App Development Team (Citi Business)** to get details, then engage a **Third-Party Vendor** with a defined scope. If the vendor has a question, they contact you, and you relay the message to the development team to get the answer.
